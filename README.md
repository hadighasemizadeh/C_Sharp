#In this repository, I am going to write all necessary to have C# scripts.

# TowerDefence
	## In this game user should generate tower to stop enemies to reach to our tower.
	
# Algorithms
	## SingleLinkedList
		#####In this program I implemented simple linked list. For those who like to
		##### know how to implement their customized linked list in C#.
	## Stack
		#####In this program I implemented simple stack. For those who like to know
		#####how to implement their customized stack in C#.
# DesignPatterns
	## Factory
		#####1-ProduceProducts: this design pattern facilitate the process of
		#####generating new item for new user. it increase the code maintainability.
		#####through this script, user can create three different products for two 
		#####different company. The key feature here is, it is extremely easy to add
		#####more customer and products without changing the base code.
		
	## Builder
		#####1-BuildComputer: this design pattern facilitate the process of building
		#####new item for new user. it increase the code maintainability.
		#####through this script, user can build two types of Computer based on given
		#####computer configuration.
		
	## Prototype
		#####ComputerPrototype: this design pattern facilitate the process of cloning an
		#####object. We can have two type of clone. First, shallow which reference will 
		#####be cloned or deep value will be cloned. I wrote both types of  prototype in 
		#####two different folders.
		
		
	## Singleton
		##### In this script I used builder design pattern script and tried to apply thread
		##### safe singleton design patterns.
		
	## Composite
		##### In this script I wrote composite component to calculate price of computer. The
		##### benefit of this design pattern is you can compose a hierarchical structure while
		##### we are composing a new object like object model (XML files)
		
	## Decorator
		#####
		
	## Iterator
		#####IterateAlienInfo: It is a simple iterator design pattern. 
		
	## Observer
		#####NotebookNotificationCenter: It consists of two methods of observer implementation
		#####I implemented both on two different products, first NoteBookPro, NoteBookLite classes
